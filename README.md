# Harvard's CS50w: Project 1, "Wiki", by Alex Symonds

## Introduction
This assignment was to make a basic Wiki site using Django. [Detailed specification here.](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/1/wiki/) Students were required to write the views (except index) and template files (except index and layout).

## Pages
* index
* entry
* results
* create
* edit
* error
* exists

## Learning Comments
My first foray into using Django. From completing this project, I learned:
* Django basics: views, templates, template inheritance
* Markdown syntax
