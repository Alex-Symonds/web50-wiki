# Harvard's CS50w: Project 1, "Wiki", by Alex Symonds

## Introduction
A simple Wiki site, made with Django.  

## Specification and Provided Materials
Students were given:
* New Django project
* index had a pre-written view, URL and HTML template
* Incomplete layout.html (form parameters and links were missing)
* CSS
* util.py, containing functions to manage and utilise the md files: list_entries, save_entry and get_entry

Students were required to:
* Add an "entry" page (view, url path and HTML template)
* Modify index.html so the list of entries became links to entry pages
* Search (view, url path, HTML template, adding action and method to the form in layout.html)
* Create (view, url path, HTML template)
* Edit (view, url path, HTML template)
* Random (view, url path)
* Importing and using python-markdown2 to convert markdown content to HTML

## Learning Comments
My first foray into using Django. From completing this project, I learned:
